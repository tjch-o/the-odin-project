        <h2> Description: </h2>
        <p class = "description"> No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. 
            If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

        <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul class = "ingredients">
            <li> 1 pound uncooked spaghetti </li>
            <li> 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup olive oil </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
            <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
            <li> 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Steps: </h2>
        <ol class = "steps">
            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
            <li> Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li> Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</li>
            <li> Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
        </ol>
