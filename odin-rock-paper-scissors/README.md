In this project, I was tasked to create a rock paper scissors game to be played between the user and the computer. The user will get to choose what shape he / she wants to use against the computer which has its shape randomly chosen. First to 5 wins. A restart button will appear when there is a winner to allow the user to play again as many times as he / she wants.

What I have learnt from this project:
- manipulating the DOM and the use of events (mainly clicking of the mouse)
- my first time incorporating Javascript into my website to make it interactive
- using Developer Tools to debug
