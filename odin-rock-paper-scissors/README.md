In this project, I was tasked to create a rock paper scissors game between the user and the computer. First to 5 wins. A restart button will appear after there is a winner to allow the user to play again as many times as they want.

What I have learnt from this project:
- manipulating the DOM and the use of events (mainly clicking of the mouse)
- my first time incorporating Javascript into my website to make it interactive
- using Developer Tools to debug
